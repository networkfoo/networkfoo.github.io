Hi I'm Philip. I live just outside of Barcelona. I'm an open source enthusiast, and now I'm learning all things Juniper. Also I am very interested in automation. I have started this site to keep track of what I'm doing and to share  my work, if it is of interest to anyone else. If you want to contact me, you can on networkfoo at gmail dot com. You can also follow me on twitter.
